            She thought this will help her to gather more information about the mafia by moving to different places with the traders.
             One day one of the mafia members recognized her. 
             He told the traders about how dangerous is she and asked them to give them Karlie, or the mafia will steal the spaceship. 
            The traders were scared. Karlie is now exposed. Traders have to make a decision. </h2>
