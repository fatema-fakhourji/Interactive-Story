        <h2>Karlie calmed herself. She started recording the bosses' faces with her special eyeglasses.
            She also used the recorder to record as much information as possible. Suddenly, a group of other mafia attacked the place.
            They were killing everyone there. Karlie was trying to survive.
            One of the mafia bosses saw her recorder and exposed her.
            He called his guard to kill her. Karlie left the place running, trying to find a place to hide.
            She found a group of space traders. She was thinking about asking for their help. </h2>
