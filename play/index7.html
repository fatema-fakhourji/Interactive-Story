        <h2>The traders helped Karlie and hid her in their spaceship. Karlie asked if she can join them and be a trader. 
            She thought this will help her to gather more information about the mafia by moving to different places with the traders.
             One day one of the mafia members recognized her. 
             He told the traders about how dangerous is she and asked them to give them Karlie, or the mafia will steal the spaceship. 
            The traders were scared. Karlie is now exposed. Traders have to make a decision. </h2>
